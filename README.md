# json-parser
demonstration of using pure javaScript to parse JSON and display results in HTML

This is to illustrate how JSON can be imported from an external source, parsed, and presented in response to user input. 
A non-trivial sized data set can be accessed in this way and held locally.
In practice the JSON would often be returned from the server side, either through fetch operations from an API or through AJAX calls.
